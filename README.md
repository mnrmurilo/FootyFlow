# FootyFlow: Data Pipeline for Football Data

This project, FootyFlow, is a data pipeline designed to collect, process, and store football-related data. It utilizes a combination of external APIs, database management, and secure credential handling to ensure efficient and reliable data operations.

## Key Features

- **Secure Credential Management:** FootyFlow leverages HashiCorp Vault to securely store and manage sensitive credentials like API keys. This ensures that your credentials are not hardcoded in your code and are protected from unauthorized access.
- **Football API Integration:** The pipeline utilizes the [apifootball.com API](https://apifootball.com/documentation/) to fetch football data like league information, team statistics, and match results. This API provides a rich dataset for analysis and insights.
- **Data Storage and Processing:**  FootyFlow uses SQLite for data storage. Data is processed and organized for efficient querying and analysis.

## Usage

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Pipeline:**
   ```bash
   python footy_processor.py
   ```

## Future Enhancements

FootyFlow has potential for expansion and improvement:

- **Additional Data Sources:** Integrate other football APIs or data sources to broaden the scope of data collected.
- **Advanced Data Processing:** Implement more complex data transformations, analysis, and visualizations using libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
- **Data Visualization:** Create interactive dashboards and visualizations to gain deeper insights from the collected data.
- **Machine Learning:** Utilize machine learning techniques to predict match outcomes, player performance, or other football-related trends.
